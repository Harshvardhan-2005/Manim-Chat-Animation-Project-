# Manim Chat Animator (MVP)
A chat-style app where the user enters a prompt and the app returns a Manim animation.

## Quick Start
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
Tested with ManimCE 0.18.x.

## Examples
- "write the title 'Fourier Series' and draw a sine wave for 4 seconds"
- "show a number line from -5 to 5, animate a dot moving to 2"
- "draw a triangle and rotate it 180 degrees"
- "plot y = sin(x) from -TAU to TAU and label axes"
